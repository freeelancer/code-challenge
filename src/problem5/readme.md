I am not sure if I understood the question correctly but what I saw was a contract that had a function to return the balance of all the erc20 tokens a customer address.
As such I assumed all the token contracts had the balanceOf function.

I did some simple testing on Solidity and it seemed to work although I am using experimental functions which are not available usually. I checked to see if it can deploy on ganache as well but did not have to time to see if the function works as intended.
